## ABOUT TOOL :

instahack is a bash based script which is officially made to test password strength of instagram account from termux with bruteforce attack and. This tool works on both rooted Android device and Non-rooted Android device.

------
 How?
------

| We use , **tor** to change our ip once blocked for many tries and continue attack.
| Since the official api is not a hacker wants, So we use the **InstagramAPK signature** to stay **anonymous!**
| And we also **save** the **progress** so that even in network interruption we can avoid breaking the computer!

 **See the 'Algorimthm' section down below for more hackery!**

-------
 What?
-------

| **Instahack** is a slick bash script to perform  **brute force** attack against **Instagram** ,   
| this script can **bypass** login limiting on wrong passwords ,  so basically it can test **infinite number of passwords**.
| Instahack is **proved** and can test **over 6M** passwords on a single instagram account with **less resource** as possible
| This script mimics the activities of the official **instagram android app** and sends request over **tor** so you are secure ,
| but if your **tor** installation is **misconfigured** then the blame is on you.
